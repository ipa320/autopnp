//This class provides an AStar pathplanner, which calculates the pathlength from one cv::Point to another. It was taken from
// http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577457-a-star-shortest-path-algorithm/ and slightly changed (to use it with openCV).
//It needs node.h to work, which gives an implementation of nodes of the graph.
//
//!!!!!!!!!Important!!!!!!!!!!!!!
//It downsamples the map mith the given factor (0 < factor < 1) so the map gets reduced and calculationtime gets better.
//If it is set to 1 the map will have original size, if it is 0 the algorithm won't work, so make sure to not set it to 0.
//The algorithm also needs the Robot radius [m] and the map resolution [mÂ²/pixel] to calculate the needed
//amount of erosions to include the radius in the planning.
